        <h3>List of what I've learnt as of Week 4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learnt the use of reponsive images, for example, images that automatically resize when you adjust your browser window, preventing images from enlarging above their normal size. </li>
            <li>Learnt more about Flex Layouts such as flex-grow which essentially controls how much items grow when there's extra space available. One example is, when I tried making a 2 column layout in one of my weekly assignments, I realised that when there's one item on one column and there isn't on another, that one item pretty much takes up the rest of the space by enlarging itself. </li>
            <li>One of the more important things I learnt is, using GitHub and creating repositories to store my codes in and make changes on it as well.</li>
            <li>Learnt how to host webpages using GitHub pages as well.</li>
        </ul>
