        <h3>List of what I've learnt as of Week 8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learnt more on Data Attributes specifically the creation of custom attributes by using "data"</li>
            <li>Learnt the Get & Set Attribute as well</li>
            <li>Learnt AJAX and how it allows new content to be loaded into part of a page and improves user experience because the user does not have to wait for an entire page to load if only a portion of the page is being updated. It's kind of like in video games where if the game loads an entire map, it'll take a long time for the player to be able to play in that map itself because the game has to load everything whereas if it were to load portions of it, it'll allow the player to play on it quicker.</li>
            <li>AJAX can be useful in loading data into the page without having to refresh. So whenever there are updates to a website, refreshing isn't needed in this case which makes things a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li>Learnt how to work with Application Programming Interfaces which allow an app or website to request stuff from another website and getting the response from it. For instance, one way is an app/website requesting weather information from weather.com API. The API from weather.com then replies with a structured response. Essentially, fetching information without having to do it the traditional way by reading the entire page/information from the external website itself.</li>
