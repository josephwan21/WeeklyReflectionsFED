        <h3>List of what I've learnt as of Week 7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learnt about DOM which stands for Document Object Model which is essentially a model created when a web browser loads a web page. </li>
            <li>The DOM Tree contains, kind of like a structure of how the html elements are placed in some sort of hierarchy. For instance, the document itself is at the highest part, folllowed by html, then its body, then the rest of the contents of the html file.</li>
            <li>For each of the nodes in the DOM Tree, they have their own colour code like yellow for "Document", green for "Element", red for "Attribute" and purple for "Text".</li>
            <li>DOM can be used as a way to access elements you want to work with, be it adding animations on a certain element like navigation links, images or even hyperlinks on JavaScript whatsoever.</li>
            <li>As for Event Handling, an event is just a "thing that happens" when your browser registers certain things that occur in a website such as clicking on a link, hovering your mouse over an element etc. </li>
            <li>By Event Handling, we could do things like input validation on html elements like forms. For instance, let's say we leave the fields blank on the forms and we set up a JavaScript code to detect that no input has been put in any of the fields, it'll give the user a warning or an error that something must be done within any of those fields.</li>
            <li>JSON Local Storange, essentially a storage based on named key/value pairs. Data is stored based on a named key, then the data can be retrieved with the same key. Data can be of any type supported by JavaScript including strings, booleans, integers, or floats. However, in the end, the data will just end up being stored as a string.</li>
        </ul>
